# Week 1 — Linear Regression (Beginner Friendly)

Welcome to **Week 1** of the `zero-to-ml` journey 👋

This week is designed for absolute beginners — people who are new to:
- Python programming  
- Basic math  
- Machine learning  

The goal is to take you from **zero** → building your **first ML model**.

This week is broken into **3 learning notebooks**:

## 📚 Notebooks for Week 1

### 1️⃣ [`01-python-primer.ipynb`](./01-python-primer.ipynb)
A gentle crash course on Python required for ML:
- Variables, data types  
- Lists & loops  
- Functions  
- Importing libraries  
- Using NumPy arrays  

### More coming soon...


## 🧩 How to Use This Week

👉 Start with **Notebook 01** even if you know some Python — it warms you up.  
👉 Ask questions anytime — no question is too small.  
👉 Make mistakes! It's part of the learning.  
👉 Every notebook has **TODOS**, **practice exercises**, and **mini quizzes**.

If you're a student:

- Fork this repo
- Create a folder `students/<your-name>/week01/`
- Copy the notebooks after you complete them
- Add your experiments or reflections

If you're a teacher:

- Use these notebooks as templates
- Add your own dataset or visuals
- Translate or simplify explanations for your audience

## 🎯 End of Week 1 Outcome

By the end of this week, you will be able to:

- Understand what a line equation is  
- Explain slope & intercept  
- Understand "error" and how models learn  
- Write basic Python code comfortably  
- Build linear regression from scratch  
- Visualize data and predictions  
- Feel **confident** instead of scared of ML  

Welcome to Week 1 🌱  
Let’s begin!
