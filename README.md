- [`week01-linear-regression`](./week01-linear-regression/) – What is ML + build your first model

## 🎯 What You'll Build

By the end of Week 1, you'll understand linear regression and build your first ML model from scratch.

**Current Content:**
- **Day 1:** Python basics (variables, lists, loops, functions, NumPy)
- **Day 2:** Math foundations (lines, slope, predictions, error)
- **Day 3+:** Coming soon...
